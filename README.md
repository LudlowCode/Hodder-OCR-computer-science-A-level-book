Useful related info for the book: errors, corrections, different versions and solutions to questions.

This book is generally very useful, but in both editions I have there are some errors, hence I made this repo. 

This repo welcomes the raising of issues and open source contributions, especially from A-level students and first-time open-source contributors.

*I am not affiliated with Hodder, OCR etc and make no gains from this.
